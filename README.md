# auto-comchap
This is a docker container that recursively scans a directory for video files and runs comchap on the video if there is no existing EDL file. This will generate an EDL file with the skipped commercials and apply the chapters to the video.

NOTE: This is work in progress. It doesn't scan anything yet. :-P
